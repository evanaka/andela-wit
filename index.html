<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g. having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.Js which allow you to add more functionality to a website than simply downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
      <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
<ul>
    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li> 
          <li>  Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
 </ul>       
        This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in the browser.</p>

  <p>JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.

        The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and executed automatically as the page loads.
        
        Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.
        
        In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.</p>

    Java script works in the following ways.</p>
    <code>function greetme(your name){
alert("Hello"+ yourName);   
}
greetme("World");</code>

<ul>
    <li>The engine (embedded if it’s a browser) reads (“parses”) the script.</li>
<li>Then it converts (“compiles”) the script to the machine language.</li>
<li>And then the machine code runs, pretty fast.</li>
</ul>

        <section class="main=section" id="Variables">
<header>Variables</header>
       <p>Like many other programming languages, JavaScript has variables. Variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.</p>
<p>Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it.</p>
<code>const PI=3.14</code>
<code>this will cause an error</code>
    </section>
        <section class="main=section" id="Scope">
<header>Scope</header>
   <p>Scope is an important aspect of JavaScript and programming in general. Scope is what limits the visibility and therefor usability of variables, functions, and objects throughout your code.</p>    
<p>Global Scope

        When you begin writing code in JavaScript, you are already in the global scope. Anything written in the global scope is accessible anywhere in your JavaScript code
        Local Scope

        Local scope is a little more complex. Locally scoped variables are only visible and accessible within their local scopes (where they are defined). You can think of local scope as any new scope that you create within the global scope.</p>
<code>if true var=5</code>

        <section class="main section" id="Fuction">
<header>Function</header>
  <p>A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program. This eliminates the need of writing the same code again and again. It helps programmers in writing modular codes. Functions allow a programmer to divide a big program into a number of small and manageable functions.</p>
  <p>Like any other advanced programming language, JavaScript also supports all the features necessary to write modular code using functions. You must have seen functions like alert() and write() in the earlier chapters. We were using these functions again and again, but they had been written in core JavaScript only once.</p>
